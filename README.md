# Ribbonwind

Ribbonwind is a 'movement tech' game project focused on adding new movement mechanics into Source. There isn't a proper end goal to the project as of current.

The codebase contains HL2, Episodic and HL2MP code and can be played using the `Source SDK Base 2013 Multiplayer` tool on Steam. Ribbonwind also has 64-bit support.

So far, sliding mechanics similar to what is found in Black Mesa, the Tau Cannon from the HL2 jeep, and some other misc things have been (re)implemented as well as a lot of code cleanup for things that Ribbonwind doesn't use.

Ribbonwind is built on the TF2 branch of the [2013 Multiplayer Source SDK](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013), so please keep in mind that many singleplayer features are currently broken. We are looking for fixes to these.

We are open to contributions to anyone interested in helping to bugfix or expand the project.

Ribbonwind is primarily developed on Linux, so Windows support is not a priority but can be maintained by other developers if there is demand for it.
